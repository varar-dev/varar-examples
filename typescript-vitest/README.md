# Varar sample: TypeScript + vitest

A small, standalone sample project that runs Markdown oaths as tests with
[Varar](https://varar.dev), using the vitest plugin (`@varar/vitest`).
Copy it as the starting point for your own project.

The `.md` files in the `varar/` directory are the oaths — they run as tests.

## Run it

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm test
```

Each example in the Markdown oaths becomes one vitest test.

## The drift baseline

`varar.lock.json` records which paragraphs are currently examples. If a step
definition is renamed or deleted, the paragraph it used to match silently
becomes prose again — the baseline is what turns that into a failing test
instead of quietly losing coverage (ADR 0002). **Commit it.**

The vitest plugin only *reads* the baseline (a Vite transform running in
parallel workers is the wrong place to write a shared file). The CLI records it:

```sh
pnpm varar          # runs the oaths and records/updates varar.lock.json
VARAR_UPDATE=1 pnpm test   # accept drift instead of failing
```

## How it fits together

- **`varar.config.json`** is the single source of truth: `docs.include` globs
  the Markdown oaths and `steps` globs the step-definition files. The vitest
  plugin drives vitest's own include/exclude from it.
- **`src/varar/*.steps.ts`** define the steps with `steps` +
  `stimulus`/`sensor`. A stimulus returns the next state, a sensor returns a
  value for Varar to compare against what the Markdown says.
- **`src/yahtzee.ts`** and **`src/roman-numerals.ts`** are the sample's
  domain code (the system under test), imported by the steps like any other
  module. Relative imports carry an explicit `.ts` extension because
  Node's ESM resolver loads the step files, and it does not
  guess extensions.

## Versioning note

In the `varar-dev/varar` monorepo this project uses `workspace:*` dependencies
(it is the dogfood suite, gating trunk); in `varar-examples` the
release sync pins them to the released npm packages.
